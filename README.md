# Microbiom_of_IAV_infection
## Description
This is a pipeline for nanopore full-length 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. The functions implemented by this pipeline include relative abundance estimator for 16S 
amplicon sequencing, read mapping state control, alpha diversity calculation and Bray-Curtis (BC) distance calculation.
